# Welcome to the AI MetabolisMX Lab

We are an emerging research group aimed at developing cutting-edge data-driven research in diabetes and metabolism using statistical modeling, high-dimensional analysis and machine learning. 

### Research
-**Data-driven metabolic subtypes**: We are working on addressing heterogeneity of metabolic diseases using multivariate methods and unsupervised machine learning in order to identify reproducible disease patterns with differential risk and treatment responses. Our current focus is on understanding heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes in Mexico and familial combined hyperlipidemia phenotypes.
<br/>
-**Low-cost metabolic risk prediction**: We have developed metabolic scores aimed at providing metabolic risk prediction with higher accuracy using low-coest approaches that can be readily reproduced in primary-care settings. Our focus in on developing these tools primarily to investigate insulin resistance related phenomena, including type 2 diabetes, visceral obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
<br/>
-**Clinical research for pathophysiological mediation**: We aim to study metabolic disease mediators in clinical research to undertand mechanisms of disease and assess potential preventive or therapeutic targets for risk prediction in Mexican population.
<br/>
-**Metabolic ageing**: An emerging field for our research goup is to delve into undertansing the interaction between metabolic diseases, ageing and age-related conditions to address the increasing metabolic burden that faces our ever-aging population
